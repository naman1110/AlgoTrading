# Introduction
This repository contains code and resources for algorithmic trading, a strategy used to automate trading decisions based on predefined rules and criteria. This README provides an overview of algorithmic trading, how it works, and details about the included trading strategy.

# What Is Algorithmic Trading?

Algorithmic trading, also known as algo trading or automated trading, is the use of computer algorithms to make trading decisions. These algorithms analyze market data, such as price, volume, and other indicators, to execute buy or sell orders automatically. Algorithmic trading aims to achieve better trading results than human traders by leveraging speed, accuracy, and the ability to execute orders based on complex strategies in real-time.

# How Is Algorithmic Trading Done?

Algorithmic trading is accomplished through a combination of software, data analysis, and trading infrastructure. Here's how it works:

Data Collection: Market data, such as stock prices, is collected in real-time or from historical sources.

Strategy Development: Traders and developers create trading algorithms that specify when to buy or sell assets. These strategies can be based on technical analysis, fundamental analysis, or a combination of factors.

Backtesting: Before deploying the algorithm, it's tested on historical data to assess its potential performance and refine it if needed.

Execution: The algorithm monitors the market, identifies trading signals based on the predefined strategy, and automatically executes orders.

Risk Management: Risk management rules are applied to limit potential losses and protect the trading capital.

Monitoring: Algorithms continuously monitor the market for trading opportunities and react accordingly.

Performance Analysis: The algorithm's performance is analyzed, and adjustments are made to optimize its results.

# Trading Strategy

The trading strategy implemented in this project is based on straddle strategy,a neutral options strategy that involves simultaneously buying both a put option and a call option for the underlying security with the same strike price and the same expiration date..
